Hello user! Thanks for being here.

This is a program made for better visualization of how Netflix's content is spread arround the world by 
content producing countries, ranking these countries, verifying the commom rate of each one and show the
distribution beteween movies and TV series. In the end it will generate a HTML file witch you can open in
your preferred browser.

The index.ipynb is the program itself and the other two files (netflix.csv and coordinates.csv) are the dadasets 
used to generate the dataframe using pandas and the coordenates that allow us to pin the markers on the world map 
using folium. For more information about these two librarys, i'm leaving the links with the documentation of each 
one in the end of this file.

Last but not least, remember to save all the files in the same paste. Otherwise you will have to specify the path 
to the files in the index.ipynb program. I hope you can appreciate this and all the feedbacks are welcome.
